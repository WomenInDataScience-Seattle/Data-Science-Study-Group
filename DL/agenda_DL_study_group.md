## Welcome to Seattle WiDS deep learning study group!

The purpose of this meetup is to complete Andrew Ng's deep learning Coursera specialization together. We are going to spend 1.5 - 2 hours every Sunday to go over the course content and also hopefully apply the methods learned in these courses to our own projects. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the theory, as well as gaining hands-on experiences. If you want to receive a certificate for the course, the cost is $49 a month. You can audit the course for free. 

**Location:**

We will be meeting in the study area of the lobby of Qwest Plaza:

1600 Seventh Ave   
Seattle, WA 98101 

## Course Overview:

There are five courses in this specialization: 

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization 
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks 
5. Sequence Models

From the Coursera website:

"In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. 

You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach."
