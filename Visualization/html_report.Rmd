This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Print first 5 rows

```{r}
DT::datatable(mtcars, filter = 'top', options = list(pageLength = 5, autoWidth = T))
```

### Compare Groups

```{r}
fig <- 
  ggplot(df,
       aes(x = Group, y = Outcome, col = Group)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(shape = Gender), 
              height = 0, width = .2) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, outlier.colour = NA, show.legend = F) 

ggplotly(fig)  

```
