# Machine Learning Study Group (@widssea)

**[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng**

**Contact: Dora Dong <doradong7@gmail.com>**

Welcome to ML study group! 

This study group will use Machine Learning course at Coursera.org as a reference. We are going to spend 1.5 - 2 hours every week to discuss the lectures, assignments, and some kaggle projects. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the theory, as well as gaining hands-on experiences. 

Topics include: 
  - Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
  - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
  - Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI)
  - Case studies and applications
  
Tools:
  The group will primarily use Python.
