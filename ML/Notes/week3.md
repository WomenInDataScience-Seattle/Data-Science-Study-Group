# Meeting note of Dec 16th, 2018

**Topics covered**

- Concepts of neural network analysis [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/jtFHI/lecture-slides). 
- Examples of applications:
  1. Prediction of fashion category;
  2. Random number generator
  3. Classify multiple categories (multiclass classification)
- Questions to think about
  1. Difference between multiclass classification vs. multilable classification (e.g., movie genres, toxic comments, fashion classifier) problems.  
    1) How to solve the mutural dependency between y_i
  2. Feature selection for neural network problems
    1) Weight initialization: adjusting feature weight 
  3. How to deal with uneven distribution in the outcome?
  
- Dataset for modeling. We discussed the dataset we would like to play around, and decided to start with the movie data. Also linked few more options in below. Feel free to use your own dataset as well. 

  1. Movie data:

     - https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
  2. [Yelp review open data](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) 
  3. Seattle public dataset
    - [Seattle Police Department 911 Incident Response](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/seattle-police-department-911-incident-response)
