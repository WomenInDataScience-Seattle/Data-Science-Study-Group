# Definitions 

## Machine Learning (Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning)

  - Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
  - Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

## Supervised Learning 
  - In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
  - Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. 
    - **Regression** predict results within a continuous output
    - **Classification** predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. 
    

## Unsupervised Learning
  - Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.
  - Derive the structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
  - No feedback based on the prediction results.
    - Eg, organize computing clusters, social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis, the "[Cocktail Party Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)"
